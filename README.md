This is a robotic project from Imperial College done with Samuel Martinet, Coleman Yau, Frederic Savuge and Sara Pohl. The project successfully implemented the PID control, wall following and basic set up of a raspberry pi robot. Finally, we have also implement a particle filter, namely monte carlo locations method, and used it to localise a robot in an unknown environment.
